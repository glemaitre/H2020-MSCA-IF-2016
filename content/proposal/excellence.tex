\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In Europe, prostate cancer is reported to be the most frequently diagnosed cancer of men and thus one of the leading cause of death of cancer~\footcite{Ferlay2013}. 
Currently, addressing this issue is a major public debate, in which the implementation of appropriate screening methods and subsequent treatments is key.
In this regard, the \ac{erspc} is conducted to investigate the potential benefits of a population-based screening~\footcite{Schroder2015}. 
The screening consists of a \ac{psa} test and depending of the \ac{psa} level measured, an additional ``blind'' biopsy is carried out. 
Despite that mortality significantly decreases, the employed screening strategy suffers of a high rate of over-diagnosis and over-treatment~\cite{Delpierre2013,Schroder2015}, due to the fact that prostate cancers grow either slowly or fast.
The slow-growing tumours account for up to~85~\% of all cancers and stay confined to the prostate gland, while the fast-growing tumours rapidly develop and metastasise to other organs, significantly affecting the morbidity and mortality rate.
Furthermore, prostate cancer is more likely to develop in specific regions of the prostate: around~70-80~\% of prostate cancers originate in the \ac{pz}, whereas~10-20~\% in the \ac{cg}, but are more aggressive and more likely to invade other organs. 
\textbf{Thus, additionally to cancer detection, the screening methods need to estimate the cancer aggressiveness to allow clinicians to act accordingly.}

In addition, the investigators of the \ac{erspc} have concluded that the use of \emph{``multi-parametric \ac{mri} and the development of new markers are the hope for the future''}.
That is why, \ac{cad} systems, revolved around mono- and multi-parametric \ac{mri}, are currently developed by the medical imaging community, and have been recently reviewed by Lema\^itre~\emph{et al.}~\footcite{Lemaitre2015}.
The developed \ac{cad} systems are designed under the same architecture as depicted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:wkfcad}. 
The available \ac{mri} modalities during prostate exam are \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, and \ac{mrsi}. 
Additionally, \ac{adc} map is based on the computation of a coefficient derived from multiple \ac{dw}-\ac{mri} acquisition.
\textbf{Currently, no \ac{cad} system has been developed using all the available modalities and thus discarding their potential discriminating power to diagnose prostate cancer.}
The closest attempts have used three of these modalities (i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}) and have discarded \ac{mrsi}~\footcite{Litjens2014}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Viswanath2011}.
This latter, however, has been shown to be extremely helpful to grade cancer aggressiveness particularly in the \ac{cg}~\footcite{Vos2015}, which is the most challenging zone in terms of cancer detection.
\textbf{Furthermore, the current researches solely focus on the delineation of prostate cancers rather than on the cancer aggressiveness assessment.}

Therefore, the aim of this project is to design a \ac{cad} system able to both detect and assess prostate cancers using all currently available multi-parametric \ac{mri} modalities.
To achieve this goal, we will revisit the different stages of the \ac{cad} framework.
First, we will insure to work with the most consistent data, enhancing them using different types of pre-processing.
Subsequently, we will segment the prostate zones using multi-parametric \ac{mri} images

These methodologies will be extensively presented and argued in Sect.\,\ref{sec:methodologies}.

\subsubsection{Research methodologies}
\label{sec:methodologies}

\paragraph{Data acquisition}

The unavailability of public dataset in medical imaging is a major drawback.
Currently, no multi-parametric \ac{mri} prostate data are publicly available, implying that no fair comparisons can be drawn between the different developed \ac{cad} systems.
Recently, Lema\^itre~\emph{et al.} launch a beta web-platform~\footnote{\texttt{http://visor.udg.edu/i2cvb/}} intended for reporting the evaluation of \ac{cad} systems.
A multi-parametric \ac{mri} dataset is made available, containing 60 patients and the following modalities: \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, and \ac{mrsi}.
Furthermore, the data are acquired from both 1.5 T and 3.0 T \ac{mri} scanner.
Multiple ground-truths (i.e., prostate zones, cancer lesions) are compiled by experienced radiologists and additional biopsy tests.
However, the web-platform need to be finalised before to be fully available.
\textbf{Consequently, we will finalise the dataset and release it publicly through our web-platform.}

\paragraph{Pre-processing}

\Ac{mri} images are corrupted by different phenomena: (i) bias field, (ii) noise, and (iii) inter-patient variations.
In this regard, particular attention to correct each of these drawbacks will be addressed.

\Ac{mri} images are affected by the inhomogeneity of the \ac{mri} field called bias field, resulting in a smooth variation of the intensities across each image.
Although bias correction methods are commonly used to enhance brain \ac{mri} images~\footcite{Vovk2007}, only one \ac{cad} system for prostate has reported to use such pre-processing~\footcite{Viswanath2009}.
The same authors have empirically evaluated the state-of-the-art methods~\footcite{viswanath2011empirical} concluding that N3 algorithm~\footcite{Sled1998} yields to better classification performance than other methods~\footcite{Styner2000}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Cohen2000}.
Recently, Lin~\emph{et al.}~\footcite{Lin2011} have proposed a method combining the N3 algorithm with the FCM algorithm~\footcite{Ahmed2002} which outperforms the original methods, in terms of breast segmentation.
\textbf{Therefore, we will compare these state-of-the-art methods~\footcite{Sled1998}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Styner2000}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Cohen2000}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Lin2011}, by ensuring the benefit of the method of Lin~\emph{et al.} for our specific application.}

Apart of the bias field, \Ac{mri} images are also degraded by a Rician noise. 
Similarly to bias correction, only two \ac{cad} systems have filtered the images using wavelet-based techniques~\footcite{Mallat2008}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Pizurica2003}, which offer a proper theoretical baseline for Rician corruption~\footcite{Nowak1999}.
Non-Local Means-based denoising techniques have extensively and successively been used for other \ac{mri} applications, but never for \ac{mri} prostate images~\footcite{Manjon2008}.
\textbf{Thus, we will evaluate the Non-Local Means-based techniques~\footcite{Manjon2012}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{Coupe2011} and wavelet-based technique\footcite{Pizurica2003} to select the appropriate method to our application.}

\ac{cad} systems are based on machine learning classifiers which are trained to differentiate cancerous from healthy tissue.
The classification performance of these classifiers highly relies on the consistency of the dataset.
Subsequently, one can emphasize the desire to reduce the inter-patient variability of the \ac{mri} dataset.
In this regard, each patient dataset needs to be standardised/normalised to a common basis, modality by modality.
Only two methods have been used in \ac{cad} for prostate: the first method consists in normalising the images via the $z$-score, while the second technique is based on a linear normalisation by parts~\footcite{Madabhushi2006a}.
Lema\^itre~\emph{et al.} have developed a normalisation technique using the Rician properties of the \ac{mri} signal~\footnote{This work is submitted for publication.}, which outperforms the previous methods for \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} images.
\textbf{Thus, we will extend this work to the other \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} and \ac{dw}-\ac{mri} modalities}.

\ac{mrsi} is a modality related to one dimensional signal, and the enhancing techniques differ from the one used in \ac{mri}.
The \ac{mrsi} spectra have to be corrected for several phenomena: phase correction, water and lipid residuals filtering, baseline correction, frequency alignment, and normalisation.
This set of enhancement techniques has already been investigated by Lema\^itre~\emph{et al.} in a study focusing solely on the \ac{mrsi} modality for prostate cancer detection~\footcite{Lemaitre2011}; \textbf{this knowledge will be the basis of \ac{mrsi} enhancement.}

\paragraph{Segmentation}

To achieve robust cancer detection, the classification has to be carried out only on the prostate area, motivating the need to perform a segmentation of the organ in the \ac{mri} images.
Furthermore, as mentioned in Sect.\,\ref{sec:introduction}, the membership \emph{a-priori} of a voxel to belong to a zone (i.e., \ac{pz} or \ac{cg}) has a high potential to increase the performance to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.
Therefore, the prostate zones need to be segmented instead of solely the prostate organ.
In this regard, only the work of Litjens~\emph{et al.} have segmented the prostate zones using a probabilistic multi-atlas approach~\footcite{Litjens2014}.
However, the segmentation was performed using only the \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} modality and the \ac{adc} map.
Although atlas-based methods are robust to intensity variations, they lack of accuracy in the boundary delineations~\footcite{Ghose2012}.
The potential of machine learning methods to carry out such task is currently underestimated, but has been shown to be suitable in combination with the other approaches (i.e., deformable models or atlas-based)~\footcite{ghose2012graph}.
\textbf{Thus, we will design a hybrid system to segment the prostate zones, based on \ac{cnn} and \ac{asm} using all multi-parametric images.}
The choice of \ac{cnn} is motivated by the recent breakthrough of deep-learning in multiple fields of computer vision.
Deep-learning, however, has still not be extensively used in the field of medical imaging as attested by the organisation of the first workshop specifically dedicated to this topic at MICCAI 2015. 
Deep-learning relies on a data-driven training stage in which large amount of data are required, which is a serious drawback in medical imaging.
However, this problem is addressed by transfer learning which allow to use deep-learning to medical imaging.

\paragraph{Registration}

In multi-parametric \ac{mri}, the data are collected in a sequential manner, involving a possible misalignment between the different modalities.
During her PhD at the Universitat de Girona, Mitra~\emph{et al.} developed an automatic multi-modal non-rigid registration method~\footcite{Mitra2012a}, which has been shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods.
This method has initially been used for registration between \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} and \ac{us} prostate images; \textbf{therefore, we will extend this method to align our multi-parametric \ac{mri} dataset.}

\paragraph{Detection and assessment}

Up to now, \ac{cad} developed systems solely focus on the detection of prostate cancers, omitting a real assessment of the lesion aggressiveness.
The detection of cancers is commonly performed using machine leaning classifiers, designing frameworks as depicted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:wkfcad}.
These frameworks rely on two compulsory stages and an intermediate optional one: (i) features detection, (ii) features selection/extraction and (iii) features classification.
Lema\^itre~\emph{et al.} have extensively reviewed researches carried out in each of this stage for the development of \ac{cad} for prostate cancer~\footcite{Lemaitre2015}.
These stages are organised in a sequential manner and thus stages upstream part of the features classification have a tremendous importance on the classification performance.
Consequently, the use of discriminative features is certainly key and most probably the bottleneck of \ac{cad} systems, justifying the attention given by researchers to evaluate multitude of low- and high-level visual features, inspired by computer vision or biology.
As aforementioned, deep-learning has been recently shown to be one of the most successful machine learning technique in broad types of classification tasks.
\ac{cnn} has the ability to generate automatically low- and high-level visual features in the network itself~\footcite{Zeiler2013} by only supplying the raw data as inputs.
Furthermore, \ac{cnn} can be trained using the Gleason grade obtained through biopsy in order to get an assessment of the aggressiveness of the cancer.
\textbf{Thus, we will detect and assess prostate cancers with \ac{cnn}. In addition, we will investigate the low- and high-level features to find potential new markers which can be used by clinicians or other machine learning methods.}

\paragraph{Evaluation using \acs*{pirads}}

The \ac{esur} together with the \ac{acr} have recently published the \ac{pirads}, which is the standard way to assess and report prostate lesions using multi-parametric \ac{mri}.
This standard allows to assign a score depending of multiple criteria such as signal intensity, texture, size of lesion, modality, prostate zones, etc.
None of the current \ac{cad} systems offer a \ac{pirads} score when detecting potential lesions in multi-parametric \ac{mri}.
\textbf{Thus, we will report the output of our classification framework in terms of \ac{pirads} score, applying the provided criterion.}
