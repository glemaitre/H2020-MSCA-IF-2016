\subsubsection{Introduction}

\paragraph{Introduction to prostate cancer imaging using multi-parametric \ac{mri}}

In Europe, prostate cancer is reported to be the most frequently diagnosed cancer of men accounting for 22.8~\%~\footcite{Ferlay2013}. 
The \ac{erspc} is conducted to investigate the potential benefits of a population-based screening~\footcite{Schroder2015}. 
The screening consists of a \ac{psa} test and depending of the \ac{psa} level measured, an additional ``blind'' biopsy is carried out. 
Despite the fact of a significant reduction of the prostate cancer mortality, the screening strategy employed suffers of a high rate of over-diagnosis and over-treatment~\cite{Delpierre2013,Schroder2015}.
In addition, the investigators of the trial has come to the conclusion that the use of ``multi-parametric \ac{mri} and the development of new markers are the hope for the future''.
