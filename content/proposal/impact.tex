\section{IMPACT}

\subsection{Enhancing research- and innovation-related human resources, skills, and working conditions to realise the potential of individuals and to provide new career perspectives}
\label{sec:enhancement}

In this section, please explain the impact of the research and training on the Experienced Researcher's career. The fellowship, including any secondments in Europe should maximise the impact on the researcher's activity on European society, including the science base and/or the economy, in a manner appropriate to the research field. 

\subsection{Effectiveness of the proposed measures for communication and results dissemination}

Required sub-headings: 

\subsubsection*{Communication and public engagement strategy of the action}
\subsubsection*{Dissemination of the research results}
\subsubsection*{Exploitation of results and intellectual property}

Concrete plans for the above must be included in the Gantt Chart. The new knowledge generated by the action should be used wherever possible to enhance the career of the researcher, to advance research, to foster innovation, and to promote the research profession to the public. 
The following sections of the European Charter for Researchers refer specifically to public engagement and dissemination:

\paragraph{Public engagement}
Researchers should ensure that their research activities are made known to society at large in such a way that they can be understood by non-specialists, thereby improving the public's understanding of science. Direct engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand public interest in priorities for science and technology and also the public's concerns. 

\paragraph{Dissemination, exploitation of results}
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are expected to take a lead in ensuring that research is fruitful and that results are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or both) whenever the opportunity arises.
