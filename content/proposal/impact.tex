\subsection{Enhancing the potential and future career prospects of the researcher}
\label{sec:enhancement}

% The proposed research aims at developing the first comprehensive \ac{cad} system for prostate cancer that can be easily adapted for breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
% It will constitute an unique tool for enhancing the radiologist's interpretation with quantitative measurements using intelligent \ac{cad} systems.
% Based on these objective measurements, this novel \ac{cad} will have the potential to be easily integrated into the clinical work-flow, advancing \ac{cad} systems beyond the current ``computer-aided display''stage and one-parametric imaging.
% This research will enable the translation of basic and applied data mining and computer vision algorithms to many cancer research areas besides prostate.
% These will include the main lethal cancers such as breast and brain and will be also applicable in other disciplines such as neuroscience or study of neurodegenerative diseases since the engineering mechanisms are the same.
% The system will enable the development of unique prostate cancer biomarkers unknown before through improved quantitative evaluation methods and data mining methods including deep-learning, that will pave the pathway to personalized management for future patients diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer, leading to reduced cost in prostate cancer screening by ultimately reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.

\paragraph{Exploitation of results and intellectual property}

% Host institutions, hereby \ac{fsu} and \ac{udg}, and the beneficiary will be required to bring in existing background knowledge and provide transparent access to other partners for the successful execution of the project.
% Prior to the start of the project and signing the \emph{Grant Agreement}, the different parties will draw up a \emph{Partnership Agreement}.
% \emph{Partnership Agreement} will specify the background brought into the project per partner and lay down rules for collaboration and matters regarding the usage of back- and foreground.
% All project participants are expected to enter the \emph{Partnership Agreement} in order to ensure confidentiality and facilitate knowledge transfer.
% All Access Rights needed for the execution of this project are granted on a non-exclusive basis and are worldwide.
% No transfer costs shall be charged by any participant for the granting of Access Rights.
% Additionally, all consortium beneficiaries have unanimously agreed on the following principles that will govern the \ac{ip} terms in this project, and form the basis of the \ac{ip} terms in the consortium agreement: Solely generated \ac{ip} will be solely owned by the generating party with a first option to the network's private sector partners to a non-exclusive option to license foreground \ac{ip} for commercialisation.
% All intellectual property generated jointly during the course of the Project (``Joint Foreground \ac{ip}'') and worldwide patent rights and copyrights arising there from shall be jointly owned by the generating parties, and shall be managed in accordance with the terms of a Joint Ownership and Management Agreement (JOMA).
% The Project Coordinator is responsible for establishment of the Consortium Agreement and intellectual property rights \ac{ip} management throughout the project lifetime.

In about three years a direct knowledge utilization from the proposed research in form of a first prototype of a \ac{cad} for prostate cancer detection and diagnosis will emerge that could be tested in clinical routine.
This project offers a \textbf{high probability that \ac{ip} of significant commercial value due to its novelty --- by being the first comprehensive \ac{cad} for prostate cancer --- and its translational research applications for example in breast cancer research}.
%The applicant in conjunction with the \ac{oitt} and Matthieu Dumont, the licensing manager of the \ac{fsu} Office of Commercialization who is responsible for management and transferring \ac{ip} into the marketplace, will look for opportunities through patents and disclosures to transfer this \ac{ip} to the private sector.
% All the necessary steps will be taken in order to protect, assess, transfer/license, any exploitable results arising from this project, in accordance with the rules of the 2020 Horizon Program for Research.
% Protecting intellectual property generated within PREDICATE will be essential for securing the technological leadership of the participating institutions.
% In order to ensure that valuable \ac{ip} is identified and appropriately protected at an early stage, all partners will review all scientific output from their respective WPs and seek \ac{ip} protection for the corresponding results if deemed appropriate.
% To allow the proper exploitation of Foreground knowledge that will require the involvement of larger industrial parties, the partners will contact third-party companies.
% If considered appropriate, additional collaborators will be approached by the project members during the course of the project.
% The expertise of the participating academic partners, and the contacts that are already in place, it will be highly feasible to properly exploit the knowledge and the results generated within PREDICATE.
% The exploitation of results will be based on the interaction with the \ac{oitt} at the \ac{udg} in order to define a strategy for a successful deployment of the developed \ac{cad} system (C3).
The hosts, hereby \ac{fsu} and \ac{udg}, in accordance with the ``European Charter for Researchers'', confirm that the researcher will secure the benefits of the exploitation (if any) of R\&D results through legal protection and, in particular, through appropriate protection of \ac{ip} rights, including copyrights. According to the host's practise, National Legislation and the recommendations of the European IPR Helpdesk\footnote{https://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/}, upon commencement of the fellowship, along with the researcher's Work Contract, a specific Agreement on Collaboration and IPR will also be prepared. This will specify: (i) the foreground and background intellectual property (e.g., materials, datasets, publications, patents, etc.) entailed and the relevant ownership and access rights of the researcher and the hosts; (ii) the identification and protection of results (including the allocation of a staff member to be an intellectual property rights manager, through the use of laboratory laboratory notebooks); (iii) the tackling of confidentiality issues (e.g., through Confidentiality Agreements, Non-Disclosure Agreements for yet-unprotected invention-patents-results); and (iv) the routes of further exploitation which for the PREDICATE project could lead the first comprehensive \ac{cad} system for prostate cancer.

% We will exploit  the  project  results  by  generating  new  intellectual  property,  collaborating with SMEs as well as external industry representatives and developing a road-map towards widespread clinical application.

% Management of \ac{ip} rights will be elaborated in the Consortium Agreement according to the rules of the EC Model Contract.
% Foreground knowledge shall be owned by the contracting Party who has generated such knowledge.
% If the Parties jointly generate the Foreground, they shall have joint ownership on basis of the ratio of effort made to obtain the knowledge.
% The Parties concerned will seek to agree between them for obtaining and/or maintaining such shared rights on a case-by-case basis.
% To avoid merging of pre-existing know-how (Background) and know-how generated in this project (Foreground), pre-existing knowledge will be investigated before the start of the project, and drawn up as an annex to the Consortium Agreement.
% The SMEs interested in ProDeepCAD will be involved in all exploitation matters resulting from the outcome of this project.


\subsection{Quality of the proposed measures to communicate the action activities to different target audiences}

\paragraph{Communication and public engagement strategy of the action}
The topic and potential results of this project are important for the general public.
G. Lema\^itre has experience in public engagement with research projects.
On several occasions he presented his work to a very broad scientific and non-scientific audience.
He contacted consumer groups to advocate for his research and draw the attention to early detection and diagnosis to a very deadly cancer among men.
Prostate cancer is extremely prevalent among African Americans in the US and talking to these under-represented and under-privileged groups will be extremely beneficial for the large-scale dissemination of the research results achieved in this project.
The \textbf{annual Computational XPosition} is the lab's vehicle to present its research result to members outside \ac{fsu}.
The project is planned to take advantage of the worldwide spreading possibilities of both languages (Spanish and English) and have a similar communication procedure through \textbf{\ac{fsu} research news and \ac{fsu} channel and Girona press channel}, media, scientific-spreading blogs, digital media (the applicant is an active user of Facebook and Twitter with a science-lover network of contacts), press and TV (Communication 1 (C1), see Gantt chart).
In addition, the applicant plans to participate in \textbf{Open-Doors activities day and organized lab tours} to attract high-school students for interdisciplinary research and for the new direction scientific computing as well as publishing blog post to popularize the pattern recognition and medical aspects of his research.
