\section{IMPLEMENTATION}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Overall coherence and effectiveness of the work plan}

The proposal should be designed in the optimal way to achieve the desired impact. A Gantt Chart should be included in the text where the following should be listed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Work Packages description;
\item List of major deliverables;
\item List of major milestones;
\item Secondments if applicable.
\end{itemize}

The schedule should be in terms of number of months elapsed from the start of the project.

\subsection{Appropriateness of the management structure and procedures, including quality management and risk management}

Develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project organisation and management structure, including the financial management strategy, as well as the progress monitoring mechanisms put in place;
\item Risks that might endanger reaching project objectives and the contingency plans to be put in place should risk occur.
\end{itemize}
The following could be also included in the Gantt Chart:
\begin{itemize}
\item Progress monitoring;
\item Risk management;
\item Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
\end{itemize}
